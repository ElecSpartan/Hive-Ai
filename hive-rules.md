Hive Rules

1. the queen bee must be placed on the board within the first four moves

2. five types of pieces each with its own moves
   	1. grasshopper
		- jump over one or more pieces **in a straight line** e.g. up->up->up, top-right->top-right->top-right, etc...
   	2. ants
		- can move to any position on the edge of the hive
		- i.e. any position in which it will have an adjacent piece but not on top of another piece
	3. spider
		- moves on the edges like ants, but can only move exactly three spaces at a time.
	4. beetle
	    - moves a single space in each direction (provided they don't split the hive)
	    - they can also hop on top of the hive
	    - beetles can hop on top of other beetles.
	5. Queen
	    - single space at a time along hive edge	
     
4. general rules
    1. no piece can move if its move will split the hive
    2.  you can't move a piece through an opening that is too narrow (e.g. top right when top and right have pieces)
        - the exceptions are beetles and grass hoppers who don't move horizontally arround the hive
    3. to win
        - surround the opponent queen from all six sides
